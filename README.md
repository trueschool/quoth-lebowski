Quoth Lebowski - an Alfred Workflow for searching for Lebowski quotes


I had previously been using a text-based script of the Big Lebowski I found on the internet to search for quotes for threads in this sub. Gradually I edited the script in markdown format to improve formatting and make it easier to search.
Then I vibecoded an Alfred workflow with Gemini so you can search from the Alfred quick launch search bar.

* Type `ql` to tell Alfred you want to invoke the plugin
* type the words to search in the movie script
* select the quote you want and press enter
* it copies the full sentence that contains your search terms to the clipboard for you to post where you want.

## Installation

Installs like any .alfredworkflow
